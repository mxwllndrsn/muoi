Muoi
=====

An easy to use flashcard application originally developed as a study aid for the [USCIS Citizenship test](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learners/study-test/study-materials-civics-test). The initial concept and python scripts borrowed from [vladimiriii/arabic-flashcards](https://github.com/vladimiriii/arabic-flashcards). 

**Muoi is no longer in development**,
