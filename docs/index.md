A Simple Flashcard Application
==============================

**Muoi** is a flashcard application designed for the quick creation of study guides by end users. Initially created to help study for the *USCIS Citizenship Exam*, it is being adapted to generate and persist custom flash cards created by anyone. 

## Stack

Muoi uses a *MERN* stack w/ React, Node, Mongo, and Heroku for the development deployment. Future migration to AWS is planned. Muoi was originally written as a single page application with jQuery. 

Development credits go to [Clint Brodar](github.com/cb721) and [Max Anderson](github.com/mxwllndrsn). It was inspired by the article [Create a flashcard app without a database](http://brettromero.com/create-flashcard-app-without-database/), by [Brett Romero](https://github.com/vladimiriii).
